12/14/2025 Updates:

1. Font Size Control ⭐ (High Priority)
What we did: Added a slider and an "Aa" control to the reading screen.

The Benefit: You can now adjust the text size (from 2rem to 6rem) in real-time while the prompter is running. This is essential if you move further away from the camera or are using a smaller laptop screen.

2. Smart Time Estimator
What we did: Added a dynamic "Est. Duration" badge on the setup screen.

The Benefit: As you paste your script or change the scroll speed, the app calculates exactly how long the video will be (e.g., "Est: 02:45"). This helps you trim your script to fit social media time limits (like 60-second Reels) before you even start recording.

3. Professional Hotkeys
What we did: Mapped specific keyboard keys to prompter actions.

Spacebar: Play/Pause.

Up/Down Arrows: Jump to the previous or next segment.

Left/Right Arrows: Speed up or slow down the scroll speed on the fly.

Escape: Reset the session.

The Benefit: You can control the prompter with a wireless clicker or a keyboard under your hand without having to look for a tiny "Pause" button with your mouse while on camera.

4. Auto-Save Draft
What we did: Integrated localStorage logic that triggers every time you type in the text area.

The Benefit: If your browser crashes, you accidentally refresh the page, or you close the tab and come back the next day, your script and speed settings are automatically restored. You’ll never lose your work again.
